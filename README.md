# Job scraper

Scrapes jobs from Indeed and displays stats about them, using a command-line interface.

## Usage

`node index.js`

> The program saves query data to the filesystem. If you've already run a query, you can use local data instead.

## Caveats
- Seems to return nothing if you make the radius too large.
